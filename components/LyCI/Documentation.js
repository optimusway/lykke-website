            <h4>What is the Lykke Crypto Index?</h4>
            <p>
              LyCI is a tool that consolidates and tracks the performance or
              value of a selection of underlying cryptocurrencies. This provides
              a snapshot of how this selection of the crypto market is
              performing overall in one single, easily understandable measure.
              This ensures that even where one cryptocurrency in the index goes
              up or down dramatically, the index will reflect the global
              performance of all the assets contained, giving a more accurate
              picture of overall market performance excluding idiosyncratic
              risks of single assets.
            </p>
            <h4>How can this help users?</h4>
            <p>
              There are several benefits to tracking the LyCI on a regular
              basis. These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Useful benchmark of individual cryptocurrencies against a
                measure of market overall performance
              </li>
              <li>
                Quick and instant measure of general performance the
                cryptocurrency markets, as measured by the largest players
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <p>
              There are several large advantages to investing directly in LyCI
              as opposed to investing in individual crypto assets
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Reduced risk by spreading your investment across a diversified
                portfolio of the largest cryptocurrencies on the market
              </li>
              <li>
                Reduced time and energy by not having to investigate and
                research individual assets, picking those that you prefer and
                ignoring those that you do not want to invest in
              </li>
              <li>
                Reduced costs through not having to address spreads across
                several transactions but only across those transactions related
                to the single index (there are no commissions on the Lykke
                Exchange)
              </li>

            <h4>What assets are included in LyCI?</h4>
            <p>
              LyCI is a weighted index which means that the proportion of each
              digital assets contained in the group is dependent on their total
              market capitalization. LyCI takes the current mid-market prices of
              the 25 cryptocurrencies with the largest market capitalization â€“
              i.e. those that are worth the most in terms of total asset value.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the time of writing the cryptocurrencies with the highest
              market cap and corresponding weights are (data from
              coinmarketcap):
